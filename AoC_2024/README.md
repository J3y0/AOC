# Advent of Code 2024

Same as before, you can find a quick access for 2024 solutions below:

Each day implements an interface with method `Part1()`, `Part2()` and `Parse()`.
The interface is defined in `./days/solution.go`

- [Day 1](./days/01_day.go)
- [Day 2](./days/02_day.go)
- [Day 3](./days/03_day.go)
- [Day 4](./days/04_day.go)
- [Day 5](./days/05_day.go)
- [Day 6](./days/06_day.go)
- [Day 7](./days/07_day.go)
- [Day 8](./days/08_day.go)
- [Day 9](./days/09_day.go)
