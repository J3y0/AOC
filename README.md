# Advent of Code 2022

I might write solutions in different languages but most of them will be in rust or golang.

You can find the quick access for year 2022 by following this link: [AoC 2022](./AoC_2022/README.md)

# Advent of Code 2023

This year, I mainly wrote my solutions using GOlang. Exceptions have been made for the last two days where I went with Python instead.

The solution links for each day of this year are available [here](./AoC_2023/README.md).

# Advent of Code 2024

This year, I mainly wrote my solutions using GO.

The solution links for each day of this year are available [here](./AoC_2024/README.md).

# Advent of Code 2025

I will use Rust for this Advent of Code 2025 edition.
