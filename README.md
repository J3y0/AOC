Trying to solve each challenge of the 2022 edition of Advent of Code

I might write solutions in different languages but most of them will be in rust.
This is a great way to learn Rust and how to tackle AOC challenges !

Here are the references to them:

- [Day 2](./day2/src/main.rs)
- [Day 3](./day3/day3.py)
- [Day 4](./day4/src/main.rs)
- [Day 5](./day5/day5.py)
- [Day 6](./day6/src/App.java)
- Day 7
- [Day 8](./day8/src/main.rs)
